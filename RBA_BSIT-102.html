        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as
            services over the internet. It eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical
            resources themselves, and only pay for what they use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="function">
        <h2>Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.OjVK4gSC7u5PW08wg7de3QAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=220"
            alt="Cloud Computing Functions" id="image-left">
        <ol id="olf">
            
            <b>Increase Data Storage Capacity </b>
            <div id="justify">
            <p>The main thing about the function of this cloud technology is where you can increase data storage
                capacity. This is certainly not without reason because with a cloud storage system you can increase data
                storage capacity.

                Just imagine that you have 32 Gb of important data on your phone and there is still data that needs to
                be stored, then the answer is to use the cloud to increase storage capacity.</p>
                </div>
            <b>Improving Stakeholder Performance</b>
            <div id="justify">
            <p>In a company, of course, there is such a thing as a stakeholder. Stakeholders of course still need to use
                cloud technology for just meeting with clients or also with employees. By using cloud technology, of
                course, this can be done easily and also with its more efficient performance, it can improve its
                performance.</p>
                </div>
            <b>Get System Updates Periodically (Up to Date) </b>
            <div id="justify">
            <p>Regular system updates are very important. This third function is the advantages and characteristics of
                cloud computing. Where, to overcome the various shortcomings that exist and imitate the development of
                the hottest issues in the era of digital-based technology, the method will continue to update the
                database in a structured manner.

                The update aims to improve security, then improve features to provide a better experience for online
                users around the world. Thus, every storage operation becomes more secure, targeted, and has high
                credibility.</p>
                </div>
            <b>Improve System Reliability </b>
            <div id="justify">
            <p>Cloud Providers guarantee a certain level of service through contracts known as Service Level Agreements
                (SLA) that make it easier for their customers to provided uninterrupted service.

                There is no more delay that could be associated with geographical distance (for a technician to go on
                site), or lead delivery time for replacement equipment. The Cloud provider takes care of the hardware
                backup strategies and maintenance updates. </p>
                </div>
            <b>Greater Flexibility and Scalability </b>
            <div id="justify">
            <p>Cloud computing is elastic and scalable; users can increase/decrease resources as needed. This allows a
                business to grow or shrink to adapt to market demands.</p>
                </div>

        <!-- Give 10 benefits and description of Cloud Computnig using the ul list you can search how the element works -->
        <ul>
            <b>Flexibility</b>
            <p>Flexibility in cloud computing means organizations can scale up and down as needed without buying any
                additional hardware.</p>
            <b>Disaster Recovery</b>
            <p>In the event of a disaster, the impacted data, applications, and resources can be reinstated either in
                the local data center or through a cloud provider, allowing the enterprise to swiftly resume regular
                operations. A disaster in this context can include natural disasters, human-made incidents, hardware
                failures, software glitches, or any other disruptive event that can have a significant impact on an
                organization’s IT infrastructure.</p>
            <b>Automatic Software Update</b>
            <p> Cloud applications update regularly. This ensures the latest security patches. It also means you always
                have the latest version and features of the application. Microsoft 365™ would be a familiar example of a
                cloud computing application that regularly updates.</p>
            <b>Cap-Ex Free</b>
            <p>CapEx in cloud computingis like the traditional CapEx model briefly outlined above. However, in this
                case, capital expenditures are all cloud-related and refer to the costs the organization must incur to
                purchase fixed assets that will offer ongoing, long-term benefits well past the current tax year.
            </p>
            <b>Increased Collaboration</b>
            <p>Cloud collaboration helps to build a sense of community through teamwork, increases productivity and
                stimulates creativity. Using this method makes it easier to make the transition to a remote workforce.
            </p>
            <b>Work From Anywhere</b>
            <p>Since files and project can be saved in cloud, it can be accesed and worked on remotely.</p>
            <b>Document Control</b>
            <p>It allows an organization to store, index, and archive its documents and information in a secured,
                centralized environment. </p>
            <b>Security</b>
            <p>Cloud security refers to the cybersecurity policies, best practices, controls, and technologies used to
                secure applications, data, and infrastructure in cloud environments. In particular, cloud security works
                to provide storage and network protection against internal and external threats, access management, data
                governance and compliance, and disaster recovery.</p>
            <b>Competitiveness</b>
            <p>Moreover, cloud computing services influence the dimensions of competitive advantages (quality, cost,
                reliability, innovation, and responsiveness) of commercial organizations, where cloud computing services
                have the most significant influence on quality followed by cost and responsiveness, respectively.</p>
            <b>Environmentally Friendly</b>
            <p>With the cloud, not only are fewer servers used, but they are powered efficiently, “reducing the carbon
                impact on a company’s data center.” VP of Marketing and Sales at Verne Global, Lisa Rhodes, says that
                “according to the Environmental Protection Agency, data centers now account for 1.5% of all electricity
                consumption in the U.S. and by 2020, carbon emissions will have quadrupled to 680 million tons per year,
                which will account for more than the aviation industry.” Cutting down on data centers by switching IT
                operations to a public cloud provider significantly lowers carbon emissions and electricity consumption.

        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ul>
            <b>Mobility</b>
            <p>Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which, considering
                over 2.6 billion smartphones are being used globally today, is a great way to ensure that no one is ever
                left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office,
                can use this feature to keep instantly up to date with clients and co-worker.
                Through the cloud, you can offer conveniently accessible information to sales staff who travel,
                freelance employees, or remote employees, for better work-life balance. Therefore, it's not surprising
                to see that organizations with employee satisfaction listed as a priority are up to 24% more likely to
                expand cloud usage.</p>
            <b>Insight</b>
            <p> As we move ever further into the digital age, it's becoming clearer and clearer that the old adage
                “knowledge is power” has taken on the more modern and accurate form: “Data is money.” Hidden within the
                millions of bits of data that surround your customer transactions and business process are nuggets of
                invaluable, actionable information just waiting to be identified and acted upon. Of course, sifting
                through that data to find these kernels can be very difficult, unless you have access to the right
                cloud-computing solution.
                Many cloud-based storage solutions offer integrated cloud analytics for a bird's-eye view of your data.
                With your information stored in the cloud, you can easily implement tracking mechanisms and build
                customized reports to analyze information organization wide. From those insights, you can increase
                efficiencies and build action plans to meet organizational goals. For example, the beverage company
                Sunny Delight was able to increase profits by about $2 million a year and cut $195,000 in staffing costs
                through cloud-based business insights.</p>
            <b>Quality Control:</b>
            <p>There are few things as detrimental to the success of a business as poor quality and inconsistent
                reporting. In a cloud-based system, all documents are stored in one place and in a single format. With
                everyone accessing the same information, you can maintain consistency in data, avoid human error, and
                have a clear record of any revisions or updates. Conversely, managing information in silos can lead to
                employees accidentally saving different versions of documents, which leads to confusion and diluted
                data.</p>
            <b>Loss Prevention</b>
            <p>If your organization isn't investing in a cloud-computing solution, then all of your valuable data is
                inseparably tied to the office computers it resides in. This may not seem like a problem, but the
                reality is that if your local hardware experiences a problem, you might end up permanently losing your
                data. This is a more common problem than you might realize computers can malfunction for many reasons,
                from viral infections, to age-related hardware deterioration, to simple user error. Or, despite the best
                of intentions, they can be misplaced or stolen (over 10,000 laptops are reported lost every week at
                major airports).
                If you aren't on the cloud, you're at risk of losing all the information you had saved locally. With a
                cloud-based server, however, all the information you've uploaded to the cloud remains safe and easily
                accessible from any computer with an internet connection, even if the computer you regularly use isn't
                working.</p>
            <b>Cost-effective Maintenance</b>
            <p>Organizations using cloud computing can save money on both hardware and software upkeep. Because cloud
                service providers manage the maintenance and updates, businesses no longer need to make costly
                infrastructure investments or set aside resources for continuous maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <img src="https://cloudacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Disadvantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1200x620.png" alt="Disadvantages of Cloud Computing" id="image-right">
        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ul>
         <b>Cloud downtime</b>
         <p>The cloud, like any other IT set-up, can experience technical problems such as reboots, network outages and downtime. These events can incapacitate business operations and processes, and can be damaging to business.</p>   
         <b>Limited control</b>   
         <p>The cloud service provider owns, manages and monitors the cloud infrastructure. You, as the customer, will have minimal control over it. You will be able to manage the applications, data and services operated on the cloud, but you won't normally have access to key administrative tasks, such as updating and managing firmware or accessing server shell.</p>   
         <b>Security and privacy</b>   
         <p>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards and industry certifications, storing data and important files on external service providers always opens up risks. Any discussion involving data must address security and privacy, especially when it comes to managing sensitive data. We must not forget what happened at Code Space and the hacking of their AWS EC2 console, which led to data deletion and the eventual shutdown of the company. Their dependence on remote cloud-based infrastructure meant taking on the risks of outsourcing everything.Of course, any cloud computing service provider is expected to manage and safeguard the underlying hardware infrastructure of a deployment. However, your responsibilities lie in the realm of user access management, and it’s up to you to carefully weigh all the risk scenarios.Though recent breaches of credit card data and user login credentials are still fresh in the minds of the public, steps have been taken to ensure the safety of data. One such example is the General Data Protection Rule (GDPR), which was recently enacted in the European Union to provide users more control over their data. Nonetheless, you still need to be aware of your responsibilities and follow best practices.</p>   
         <b>Vulnerability to attack</b>   
         <p>Going on with the drawbacks of cloud computing, another one concerns vulnerability: in cloud computing, every component is online, which exposes potential vulnerabilities. Even the best teams suffer severe attacks and security breaches from time to time. Since cloud computing is built as a public service, it’s easy to run before you learn to walk. After all, no one at a cloud vendor checks your administration skills before granting you an account: all it takes to get started is generally a valid credit card.</p>   
         <b>Vendor lock-in</b>   
         <p>Vendor lock-in is another perceived disadvantage of cloud computing. Easy switching between cloud services is a service that hasn’t yet completely evolved, and organizations may find it difficult to migrate their services from one vendor to another. Differences between vendor platforms may create difficulties in migrating from one cloud platform to another, which could equate to additional costs and configuration complexities. Gaps or compromises made during migration could also expose your data to additional security and privacy vulnerabilities.</p>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <!-- For you as a student what is the help of Cloud Computing in
        your daily life in schools and personal uses, Will you also recommend 
        using cloud for the others -->
     <p>As a student,gathering learning resources nowadays was made really easy with the use and introduction of cloud computing.I would really recommend it to others for it will also make their daily lives better and easier to live and enjoy in.</p>
